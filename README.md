# Basics-of-Bitwise-Operator
Aim:To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Theory:Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on binary (bit-level) data.

They directly manipulate bits of integer values.

Bitwise operators are mainly used in:

1.Low-level programming

2.Optimization

3.Embedded systems

4.Cryptography
